old is gold.
old habits die hard.
An old tree provides good shade.
Do not discard old memories.
Old friends are like fine wine.
Repairing an old car can be satisfying.
Reading old books is a joy.
The house has an old, rustic charm.
Old traditions still hold value in modern times.
An old photo album brings back memories.
